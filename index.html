          <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
          <p>In this research project, we planned and conducted interviews with five frequent flyers from around the nation. Followed by two Instagram surveys consisting of ten different polls or questions.</p>
          <p>We began by choosing 5 users to administer interviews with in order to understand what struggles they endured whilst traveling among a pandemic. 
            </p>
          <p>We also created a series of Instagram Polls on our respective accounts which collectively reached over<br> 1,600 followers. 
            The survey consisted of 10 questions and ran on our two accounts for 24 hours each.</p>

        <p>Immediately, we found that Covid-19 tremendously affected all aspects of their normal travel routine. <br> 
          Interviews revealed that booking travel plans changed significantly due to the risks and annoyances<br> associated with covid reports, statistics, protocols, and more.</p>

    <div class="quoteContainer"><p class="quoteOrange quote">     “That’s probably been the hardest part of traveling right now, or trying to plan for traveling. You can’t look out as far as you were before because things change so quickly. Spikes could happen in different cities and things like that, events get cancelled last minute...planning around it and really kind of solidifying that. It’s just always up in the air a little bit.”</p>
